empty street, an empty house. A hole inside my heart. I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.
I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together, oh, yeah.

And all my love, I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love.
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the  fields are green to see you once again, my love.
